# Obsidian Stoic Theme

![](./Stoic_Banner.jpg)

> A minimalist, high contrast Obsidian Theme with just Black and White colors in representation of the duality of external and internal events.

## Scripts

### Develop

Run.. 

```sh
npm run watch:stoic
```

..and open the `design-vault` to instantly see the reflected changes.

### Publish and distribute

Since this project is still under development, I currently have me own distribution workflow based on some of my custom scripts.
This will change of course once, this theme is published for Obsidian officially.

All I need to do is..

```sh
npm run dist && update.sh --stoic
```
