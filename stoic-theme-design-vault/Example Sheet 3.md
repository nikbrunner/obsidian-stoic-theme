## Initial thoughts

This is my initial thoughts on a **theme** for [[Obsidian]].
![[Stoic Obsidian Theme ( Initiale Idee ).m4a]]

In continuation of the idea I also got the idea for a **plugin**.
![[Stoic Obsidian Plugin ( Initiale Idee ).m4a]]

> A minimalistic, high contrast Obsidian Theme with just Black and White colors in representation of the duality of external and internal events.
